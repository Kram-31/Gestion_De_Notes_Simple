üöÄ How to use
Prerequisites
To compile and run this project, you will need the following installed on your system:

make: A utility to automate compilation.

A C compiler (e.g., gcc or clang).

Compilation
Clone the repository (or download the files if you are not using Git):

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Kram-31/gestion-de-notes-simple.git # Replace with your repository URL
cd gestion-de-notes-simple
```
Compile the project using make:


```bash
make
```

This will create a build/ directory containing the object files and the Prog executable at the root of the project.

Execution
Once compiled, you can launch the application:

```Bash

./Prog
```
You will be greeted by a menu of options to interact with the note manager.

Cleanup
The Makefile includes several commands to clean up generated files:
```Bash
make clean: // Deletes all object files (.o) and the build/ directory.
```
```bash
make fclean: // Deletes all files generated by the compilation, including object files, the build/ directory, and the Prog executable.
```
```bash
make re:  // Executes fclean then all, which completely cleans the project and recompiles it.
```
