```Bash
make clean: // Deletes all object files (.o) and the build/ directory.
```
```bash
make fclean: // Deletes all files generated by the compilation, including object files, the build/ directory, and the Prog executable.
```
```bash
make re:  // Executes fclean then all, which completely cleans the project and recompiles it.
```
